    <h1>Ruby Business UK</h1>

    <p>The next meetup is at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/rubybizuk-november/">11am on 14th November 2012</a>.</p>

    <p>Let’s get together and chat about best practice Ruby development, and do some good old fashioned business networking. There’s no set agenda: just turn up and discuss Ruby in the business community. Mostly for Ruby consultants and owners of software development shops, although any people interested in the subject are welcome. See you at 11am at the Benugo Bar!</p>

    <p>Find us on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/series/rubybizuk/">Lanyrd</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/rubybizuk">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/rubybizuk">Google Groups</a>.</p>
